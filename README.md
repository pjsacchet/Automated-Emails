# Automated-Emails
### Patrick Sacchet 
In this personal project I aim to create a Python Script that can automatically email my team members their training at the start of each day.

# How:
Using the SMTP, email, and xlrd libraries along with a Raspberry Pi run server I plan to automate the process of emailing each individual team member of mine their training over the summer. The Raspberry Pi will be automated using
CRON and will be run locally from my home. From there I will load the program to fetch the list of team members
along with their emails and format the email using the information I provide in a Excel sheet.

# Why:
We all know it can be difficult to keep up with our training over the summer, the purpose of this program is to help my team members stay on track with their training, along with allowing myself to be introduced to the Raspberry Pi and it's capability of automation for tasks.

# Reflection:
Although I now consider this project 'complete' I look forward to progressing my skills with my Raspberry Pi and my own ability to ease task automation in day to day life.
