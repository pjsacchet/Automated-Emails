# Automated-Emails
In this personal project I aim to create a Python Script that can automatically email my team members their training at the start of each day.

# How:
Using the SMTP, email, and pyxll libraries along with a Raspberry PI run server I plan to automate the process of emailing each individual team member of mine their training over the summer. The Raspberry PI will be automated using
CRON and will be run locally from my home. From there I will load the program here to fetch the list of team members
along with their emails and format the email using the information I provide in a Excel sheet.
